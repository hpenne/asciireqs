|===

=== Hierarchical specifications

This is a single requirement using a table "form" format, which will more easily accommodate more attributes:

[.req]
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|UR-RMS-REQ-021
|Child: SW-RMS-REQ-021
|Tags: Rel-1
3+|The SW shall support hierarchical specifications documents, and links between parent and child requirements.
|===


=== Reporting
